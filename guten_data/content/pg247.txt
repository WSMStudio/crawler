	A (named ? in the English, and most commonly â in other languages). The first letter of the English and of many other alphabets. The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western Europe, as also the small letter (a), besides the forms in Italic, black letter, etc., are all descended from the old Latin A, which was borrowed from the Greek Alpha, of the same form; and this was made from the first letter (?) of the Phoenician alphabet, the equivalent of the Hebrew Aleph, and itself from the Egyptian origin. The Aleph was a consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not an element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to represent their vowel Alpha with the â sound, the Phoenician alphabet having no vowel symbols.
	This letter, in English, is used for several different vowel sounds. See Guide to pronunciation,  43Ã74. The regular long a, as in fate, etc., is a comparatively modern sound, and has taken the place of what, till about the early part of the 17th century, was a sound of the quality of â (as in far).
	2. (Mus.) The name of the sixth tone in the model major scale (that in C), or the first tone of the minor scale, which is named after it the scale in A minor. The second string of the violin is tuned to the A in the treble staff. Ã A sharp (A#) is the name of a musical tone intermediate between A and B.Ã A flat (A?) is the name of a tone intermediate between A and G.
	A per se (L. per se by itself), one preâ°minent; a nonesuch. [Obs.]
	O fair Creseide, the flower and A per se
	Of Troy and Greece.
Chaucer.
	A (? emph. ?). 1. [Shortened form of an. AS. ? one. See One.] An adjective, commonly called the indefinite article, and signifying one or any, but less emphatically. Â½At a birthÂ¸; Â½In a wordÂ¸; Â½At a blowÂ¸. Shak. It is placed before nouns of the singular number denoting an individual object, or a quality individualized, before collective nouns, and also before plural nouns when the adjective few or the phrase great many or good many is interposed; as, a dog, a house, a man; a color; a sweetness; a hundred, a fleet, a regiment; a few persons, a great many days. It is used for an, for the sake of euphony, before words beginning with a consonant sound [for exception of certain words beginning with h, see An]; as, a table, a woman, a year, a unit, a eulogy, a ewe, a oneness, such a one, etc. Formally an was used both before vowels and consonants.
	2. [Originally the preposition a (an, on).] In each; to or for each; as, Â½twenty leagues a dayÂ¸, Â½a hundred pounds a yearÂ¸, Â½a dollar a yardÂ¸, etc.
	A (?), prep. [Abbreviated form of an (AS. on). See On.] 1. In; on; at; by. [Obs.] Â½A God's name.Â¸ Â½Torn a pieces.Â¸ Â½Stand a tiptoe.Â¸ Â½A SundaysÂ¸ Shak. Â½Wit that men have now a days.Â¸ Chaucer. Â½Set them a work.Â¸ Robynson (More's Utopia)
	2. In process of; in the act of; into; to; Ã used with verbal substantives in Ãing which begin with a consonant. This is a shortened form of the preposition an which was used before the vowel sound); as in a hunting, a building, a begging. Â½Jacob, when he was a dyingÂ¸ Heb. xi. 21. Â½We'll a birding together.Â¸ Â½ It was a doing.Â¸ Shak. Â½He burst out a laughing.Â¸ Macaulay. The hyphen may be used to connect a with the verbal substantive (as, aÃhunting, aÃbilding) or the words may be written separately. This form of expression is now for the most part obsolete, the a being omitted and the verbal substantive treated as a participle.
	A. [From AS. of off, from. See Of.] Of. [Obs.] Â½The name of John a Gaunt.Â¸ Â½What time a day is it ?Â¸ Shak. Â½It's six a clock.Â¸ B. Jonson.
	A. A barbarous corruption of have, of he, and sometimes of it and of they. Â½So would I a doneÂ¸ Â½A brushes his hat.Â¸
Shak.
	A. An expletive, void of sense, to fill up the meter
	A merry heart goes all the day,
	Your sad tires in a mileÃa.
Shak.
	AÃ. A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from various sources. (1) It frequently signifies on or in (from an, a forms of AS. on), denoting a state, as in afoot, on foot, abed, amiss, asleep, aground, aloft, away (AS. onweg), and analogically, ablaze, atremble, etc. (2) AS. of off, from, as in adown (AS. ofdÂne off the dun or hill). (3) AS. ? (Goth. usÃ, urÃ, Ger. erÃ), usually giving an intensive force, and sometimes the sense of away, on, back, as in arise, abide, ago. (4) Old English yÃ or iÃ (corrupted from the AS. inseparable particle geÃ, cognate with OHG. gaÃ, giÃ, Goth. gaÃ), which, as a prefix, made no essential addition to the meaning, as in aware. (5) French â¦ (L. ad to), as in abase, achieve. (6) L. a, ab, abs, from, as in avert. (7) Greek insep. prefix ? without, or privative, not, as in abyss, atheist; akin to E. unÃ.
	Besides these, there are other sources from which the prefix a takes its origin.
	A 1 (?). A registry mark given by underwriters (as at Lloyd's) to ships in firstÃclass condition. Inferior grades are indicated by A 2 and A 3.

Goth. bandwjan to show by signs, to designate OHG. banproclamation. The word meant to proclaim, put under a ban, put under control; hence, as in OE., to compel, subject, or to leave in the control of another, and hence, to give up. See Ban.] 1. To cast or drive out; to banish; to expel; to reject. [Obs.]
	That he might ... abandon them from him.
Udall.
	Being all this time abandoned from your bed.
Shak.
	2. To give up absolutely; to forsake entirely ; to renounce utterly; to relinquish all connection with or concern on; to desert, as a person to whom one owes allegiance or fidelity; to quit; to surrender.
	Hope was overthrown, yet could not be abandoned.
I. Taylor.
	3. Reflexively : To give (one's self) up without attempt at selfÃcontrol ; to yield (one's self) unrestrainedly ; Ã often in a bad sense.
	He abandoned himself ... to his favorite vice.
Macaulay.
	4. (Mar. Law) To relinquish all claim to; Ã used when an insured person gives up to underwriters all claim to the property covered by a policy, which may remain after loss or damage by a peril insured against.
	Syn.Ã To give up; yield; forego; cede; surrender; resign; abdicate; quit; relinquish; renounce; desert; forsake; leave; retire; withdraw from. Ã To Abandon, Desert, Forsake. These words agree in representing a person as giving up or leaving some object, but differ as to the mode of doing it. The distinctive sense of abandon is that of giving up a thing absolutely and finally; as, to abandon one's friends, places, opinions, good or evil habits, a hopeless enterprise, a shipwrecked vessel. Abandon is more widely applicable than forsake or desert. The Latin original of desert appears to have been originally applied to the case of deserters from military service. Hence, the verb, when used of persons in the active voice, has usually or always a bad sense, implying some breach of fidelity, honor, etc., the leaving of something which the person should rightfully stand by and support; as, to desert one's colors, to desert one's post, to desert one's principles or duty. When used in the passive, the sense is not necessarily bad; as, the fields were deserted, a deserted village, deserted halls. Forsake implies the breaking off of previous habit, association, personal connection, or that the thing left had been familiar or frequented; as, to forsake old friends, to forsake the paths of rectitude, the blood forsook his cheeks. It may be used either in a good or in a bad sense.
	AÃbanÂ¶don, n. [F. abandon. fr. abandonner. See Abandon, v.] Abandonment; relinquishment. [Obs.]
	ÃAÂ·banÂ·donÂ¶ (?), n. [F. See Abandon.] A complete giving up to natural impulses; freedom from artificial constraint; careless freedom or ease.
	AÃbanÂ¶doned (?), a. 1. Forsaken, deserted. Â½Your abandoned streams.Â¸
Thomson.
	2. SelfÃabandoned, or given up to vice; extremely wicked, or sinning without restraint; irreclaimably wicked ; as, an abandoned villain.
	Syn.Ã Profligate; dissolute; corrupt; vicious; depraved; reprobate; wicked; unprincipled; graceless; vile. Ã Abandoned, Profligate, Reprobate. These adjectives agree in expressing the idea of great personal depravity. Profligate has reference to open and shameless immoralities, either in private life or political conduct; as, a profligate court, a profligate ministry. Abandoned is stronger, and has reference to the searing of conscience and hardening of heart produced by a man's giving himself wholly up to iniquity; as, a man of abandoned character. Reprobate describes the condition of one who has become insensible to reproof, and who is morally abandoned and lost beyond hope of recovery.
	 God gave them over to a reprobate mind.
Rom. i. 28.
	AÃbanÂ¶donedÃly, adv. Unrestrainedly.

	4. Careless freedom or ease; abandon. [R.]
Carlyle.
	ÃAÃbanÂ¶Ãdum (?), n. [LL. See Abandon.] (Law) Anything forfeited or confiscated.
	AbÂ¶aÃnet (?), n. See Abnet.
	ÃAÃbanÂ¶ga (?), n. [Name given by the negroes in the island of St. Thomas.] A West Indian palm; also the fruit of this palm, the seeds of which are used as a remedy for diseases of the chest.

Bailey.
	AbÂ·arÃticÂ·uÃlaÂ¶tion (?), n. [L. ab + E. articulation : cf. F. abarticulation . See Article.] (Anat.) Articulation, usually that kind of articulation which admits of free motion in the joint; diarthrosis.
Coxe.
	AÃbaseÂ¶ (?), v.t. [imp.&p.p. Abased (?); p.pr. & vb. n. Abasing.] [F. abaisser, LL. abassare, abbassare ; ad + bassare, fr. bassus low. See Base, a.]
	1. To lower or depress; to throw or cast down; as, to abase the eye. [Archaic]
Bacon.
	Saying so, he abased his lance.
Shelton.
	2. To cast down or reduce low or lower, as in rank, office, condition in life, or estimation of worthiness; to depress; to humble; to degrade.
	Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased.
Luke xiv.ll.
	Syn.Ã To Abase, Debase, Degrade. These words agree in the idea of bringing down from a higher to a lower state. Abase has reference to a bringing down in condition or feelings; as to abase one's self before God. Debase has reference to the bringing down of a thing in purity, or making it base. It is, therefore, always used in a bad sense, as, to debase the coin of the kingdom, to debase the mind by vicious indulgence, to debase one's style by coarse or vulgar expressions. Degrade has reference to a bringing down from some higher grade or from some standard. Thus, a priest is degraded from the clerical office. When used in a moral sense, it denotes a bringing down in character and just estimation; as, degraded by intemperance, a degrading employment, etc. Â½Art is degraded when it is regarded only as a trade.Â¸
	AÃbasedÂ¶ (?), a. 1. Lowered; humbled.
	2. (Her.) [F. abaissâ.] Borne lower than usual, as a fess; also, having the ends of the wings turned downward towards the point of the shield.
	AÃbasÂ¶edÃly (?), adv. Abjectly; downcastly.

	AÃbasÂ¶er (?), n. He who, or that which, abases.
	AÃbashÂ¶ (?), v.t. [imp. & p.p. Abashed (?); p.pr. & vb. n. Abashing.] [OE. abaissen, abaisshen, abashen, OF.esbahir, F. âbahir, to astonish, fr. L. ex + the interjection bah, expressing astonishment. In OE. somewhat confused with abase. Cf. Finish.] To destroy the selfÃpossession of; to confuse or confound, as by exciting suddenly a consciousness of guilt, mistake, or inferiority; to put to shame; to disconcert; to discomfit.
	Abashed, the devil stood,
	And felt how awful goodness is.
Milton.
	He was a man whom no check could abash.
Macaulay.
	Syn.Ã To confuse; confound; disconcert; shame. Ã To Abash, Confuse, Confound. Abash is a stronger word than confuse, but not so strong as confound. We are abashed when struck either with sudden shame or with a humbling sense of inferiority; as, Peter was abashed in the presence of those who are greatly his superiors. We are confused when, from some unexpected or startling occurrence, we lose clearness of thought and selfÃpossession. Thus, a witness is often confused by a severe crossÃexamination; a timid person is apt to be confused in entering a room full of strangers. We are confounded when our minds are overwhelmed, as it were, by something wholly unexpected, amazing, dreadful, etc., so that we have nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually confounded at the discovery of his guilt.
	Satan stood
	Awhile as mute, confounded what to say.
Milton.
	AÃbashÂ¶edÃly (?), adv. In an abashed manner.
	AÃbashÂ¶ment (?), n. [Cf. F. âbahissement.] The state of being abashed; confusion from shame.

	AÃbatÂ¶aÃble (?), a. Capable of being abated; as, an abatable writ or nuisance.
	AÃbateÂ¶ (?), v.t. [imp.& p.p. Abated, p.pr.& vb.n. Abating.] [OF. abatre to beat down, F. abattre, LL. abatere; ab or ad + batere, battere (popular form for L. batuere to beat). Cf. Bate, Batter.]
	1. To beat down; to overthrow. [Obs.]
	The King of Scots ... sore abated the walls.
Edw.Hall.
	2. To bring down or reduce from a higher to a lower state, number, or degree; to lessen; to diminish; to contract; to moderate; toto cut short; as, to abate a demand; to abate pride, zeal, hope.
	His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
Deut.xxxiv.7.
	3. To deduct; to omit; as, to abate something from a price.
	Nine thousand parishes, abating the odd hundreds.
Fuller.
	4. To blunt. [Obs.]
	To abate the edge of envy.
Bacon.
	5. To reduce in estimation; to deprive. [Obs.]
	She hath abated me of half my train.
Shak.
	6. (Law) (a) To bring entirely down or put an end to; to do away with; as, to abate a nuisance, to abate a writ. (b) (Eng. Law) To diminish; to reduce. Legacies are liable to be abated entirely or in proportion, upon a deficiency of assets.

	AÃbateÂ¶ (?), v.i. [See Abate, v.t.] 1. To decrease, or become less in strength or violence; as, pain abates, a storm abates.
	The fury of Glengarry ... rapidly abated.
Macaulay.
	2. To be defeated, or come to naught; to fall through; to fail; as, a writ abates.
	To abate into a freehold, To abate in lands (Law), to enter into a freehold after the death of the last possessor, and before the heir takes possession. See Abatement, 4.
	Syn.Ã To subside; decrease; intermit; decline; diminish; lessen. Ã To Abate, Subside. These words, as here compared, imply a coming down from some previously raised or exited state. Abate expresses this in respect to degrees, and implies a diminution of force or of intensity; as, the storm abates, the cold abates, the force of the wind abates; or, the wind abates, a fever abates. Subside (to settle down) has reference to a previous state of agitation or commotion; as, the waves subside after a storm, the wind subsides into a calm. When the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be observed. If we conceive of a thing as having different degrees of intensity or strength, the word to be used is abate. Thus we say, a man's anger abates, the ardor of one's love abates, Â½Winter rage abatesÂ¸. But if the image be that of a sinking down into quiet from preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is subside; as, the tumult of the people subsides, the public mind subsided into a calm. The same is the case with those emotions which are tumultuous in their nature; as, his passion subsides, his joy quickly subsided, his grief subsided into a pleasing melancholy. Yet if, in such cases, we were thinking of the degree of violence of the emotion, we might use abate; as, his joy will abate in the progress of time; and so in other instances.

Syn. Ã Capacity; talent; cleverness; faculty; capability; efficiency; aptitude; aptness; address; dexterity; skill. Ability, Capacity. These words come into comparison when applied to the higher intellectual powers. Ability has reference to the active exercise of our faculties. It implies not only native vigor of mind, but that ease and promptitude of execution which arise from mental training. Thus, we speak of the ability with which a book is written, an argument maintained, a negotiation carried on, etc. It always something to be done, and the power of doing it. Capacity has reference to the receptive powers. In its higher exercises it supposes great quickness of apprehension and breadth of intellect, with an uncommon aptitude for acquiring and retaining knowledge. Hence it carries with it the idea of resources and undeveloped power. Thus we speak of the extraordinary capacity of such men as Lord Bacon, Blaise Pascal, and Edmund Burke. Â½Capacity,Â¸ says H. Taylor, Â½is requisite to devise, and ability to execute, a great enterprise.Â¸ The word abilities, in the plural, embraces both these qualities, and denotes high mental endowments.

Syn. Ã To Abolish, Repeal, Abrogate, Revoke, Annul, Nullify, Cancel. These words have in common the idea of setting aside by some overruling act. Abolish applies particularly to things of a permanent nature, such as institutions, usages, customs, etc.; as, to abolish monopolies, serfdom, slavery. Repeal describes the act by which the legislature of a state sets aside a law which it had previously enacted. Abrogate was originally applied to the repeal of a law by the Roman people; and hence, when the power of making laws was usurped by the emperors, the term was applied to their act of setting aside the laws. Thus it came to express that act by which a sovereign or an executive government sets aside laws, ordinances, regulations, treaties, conventions, etc. Revoke denotes the act or recalling some previous grant which conferred, privilege, etc.; as, to revoke a decree, to revoke a power of attorney, a promise, etc. Thus, also, we speak of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Annul is used in a more general sense, denoting simply to make void; as, to annul a contract, to annul an agreement. Nullify is an old word revived in this country, and applied to the setting of things aside either by force or by total disregard; as, to nullify an act of Congress. Cancel is to strike out or annul, by a deliberate exercise of power, something which has operative force.

They are chiefly used in a figurative sense and may be distinguished by a reference to their etymology.

We speak of a person as ebgrossed (lit., seized upon in the gross, or wholly) by something which occupies his whole time and thoughts, as the acquisition of wealth, or the attainment of honor. We speak of a person (under a stronger image) as swallowed up and lost in that which completely occupies his thoughts and feelings, as in grief at the death of a friend, or in the multiplied cares of life. We speak of a person as engulfed in that which (like a gulf) takes in all his hopes and interests; as, engulfed in misery, ruin, etc.

2. (Chem.) One of a class of compounds, generally but not always distinguished by their sour taste, solubility in water, and reddening of vegetable blue or violet colors. They are also characterized by the power of destroying the distinctive properties of alkalies or bases, combining with them to form salts, at the same time losing their own peculiar properties. They all contain hydrogen, united with a more negative element or radical, either alone, or more generally with oxygen, and take their names from this negative element or radical. Those which contain no oxygen are sometimes called hydracids in distinction from the others which are called oxygen acids or oxacids.
Âµ In certain cases, sulphur, selenium, or tellurium may take the place of oxygen, and the corresponding compounds are called respectively sulphur acids or sulphacids, selenium acids, or tellurium acids. When the hydrogen of an acid is replaced by a positive element or radical, a salt is formed, and hence acids are sometimes named as salts of hydrogen; as hydrogen nitrate for nitric acid, hydrogen sulphate for sulphuric acid, etc. In the old chemistry the name acid was applied to the oxides of the negative or nonmetallic elements, now sometimes called anhydrides.

Syn. - Admission; access; entrance; initiation. - Admittance, Admission. These words are, to some extent, in a state of transition and change. Admittance is now chiefly confined to its primary sense of access into some locality or building. Thus we see on the doors of factories, shops, etc.  Â½No admittance.Â¸ Its secondary or moral sense, as Â½admittance   to the church,Â¸ is almost entirely laid aside. Admission has taken to itself the secondary or figurative senses; as, admission to the rights of citizenship; admission to the church; the admissions made by one of the parties in a dispute. And even when used in its primary sense, it is not identical with admittance. Thus, we speak of admission into a country, territory, and other larger localities, etc., where admittance could not be used. So, when we speak of admission to a concert or other public assembly, the meaning is not perhaps exactly that of admittance, viz., access within the walls of the building, but rather a reception into the audience, or access to the performances. But the lines of distinction on this subject are one definitely drawn.

Goldsmith.
Syn. - To deck; decorate; embellish; ornament; beautify; grace; dignify; exalt; honor. - To Adorn, Ornament, Decorate, Embellish. We decorate and ornament by putting on some adjunct which is attractive or beautiful, and which serves to heighten the general effect. Thus, a lady's head-dress may be ornament or decorated with flowers or jewelry; a hall may be decorated or ornament with carving or gilding, with wreaths of flowers, or with hangings. Ornament is used in a wider sense than decorate. To embellish is to beautify or ornament richly, not so much by mere additions or details as by modifying the thing itself as a whole. It sometimes means gaudy and artificial decoration. We embellish a book with rich engravings; a style is embellished with rich and beautiful imagery; a shopkeeper embellishes his front window to attract attention. Adorn is sometimes identical with decorate, as when we say, a lady was adorned with jewels. In other cases, it seems to imply something more. Thus, we speak of a gallery of paintings as adorned with the works of some of the great masters, or adorned with noble statuary and columns. Here decorated and ornamented would hardly be appropriate. There is a value in these works of genius beyond mere show and ornament. Adorn may be used of what is purely moral; as, a character adorned with every Christian grace. Here neither decorate, nor ornament, nor embellish is proper.

Some virtues are seen only in affliction.
Addison.
Syn. Ã Calamity; sorrow; distress; grief; pain; adversity; misery; wretchedness; misfortune; trouble; hardship. Ã Affliction, Sorrow, Grief, Distress. Affliction and sorrow are terms of wide and general application; grief and distress have reference to particular cases. Affliction is the stronger term. The suffering lies deeper in the soul, and usually arises from some powerful cause, such as the loss of what is most dear Ã friends, health, etc. We do not speak of mere sickness or pain as Â½an affliction,Â¸ though one who suffers from either is said to be afflicted; but deprivations of every kind, such as deafness, blindness, loss of limbs, etc., are called afflictions, showing that term applies particularly to prolonged sources of suffering. Sorrow and grief are much alike in meaning, but grief is the stronger term of the two, usually denoting poignant mental suffering for some definite cause, as, grief for the death of a dear friend; sorrow is more reflective, and is tinged with regret, as, the misconduct of a child is looked upon with sorrow. Grief is often violent and demonstrative; sorrow deep and brooding. Distress implies extreme suffering, either bodily or mental. In its higher stages, it denotes pain of a restless, agitating kind, and almost always supposes some struggle of mind or body. Affliction is allayed, grief subsides, sorrow is soothed, distress is mitigated.

2. Any. [Obs.] Â½Without all remedy.Â¸

This word, not only in popular language, but in the Scriptures, often signifies, indefinitely, a large portion or number, or a great part. Thus, all the cattle in Egypt died, all Judea and all the region round about Jordan, all men held John as a prophet, are not to be understood in a literal sense, but as including a large part, or very great numbers.

All to, or AllÃto. In such phrases as Â½all to rent,Â¸ all to break,Â¸ Â½allÃto frozen,Â¸ etc., which are of frequent occurrence in our old authors, the all and the to have commonly been regarded as forming a compound adverb, equivalent in meaning to entirely, completely, altogether. But the sense of entireness lies wholly in the word all (as it does in Â½all forlorn,Â¸ and similar expressions), and the to properly belongs to the following word, being a kind of intensive prefix (orig. meaning asunder and answering to the LG. terÃ, HG. zerÃ). It is frequently to be met with in old books, used without the all. Thus Wyclif says, Â½The vail of the temple was to rent:Â¸ and of Judas, Â½He was hanged and toÃburst the middle:Â¸ i. e., burst in two, or asunder. Ã All along. See under Along. Ã All and some, individually and collectively, one and all. [Obs.] Â½Displeased all and some.Â¸ Fairfax. Ã All but. (a) Scarcely; not even. [Obs.] Shak.

Â½There they [certain phenomena] remain rooted all the same, whether we recognize them or not.Â¸ J. C. Shairp. Â½But Rugby is a very nice place all the same.Â¸ T. Arnold. Ã See also under All, n.
 All (?), n. The whole number, quantity, or amount; the entire thing; everything included or concerned; the aggregate; the whole; totality; everything or every person; as, our all is at stake.

Gen. xxxi. 43.
All is used with of, like a partitive; as, all of a thing, all of us.
After all, after considering everything to the contrary; nevertheless. Ã All in all, a phrase which signifies all things to a person, or everything desired; (also adverbially) wholly; altogether.
Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee,
Forever.

All in the wind (Naut.), a phrase denoting that the sails are parallel with the course of the wind, so as to shake. Ã All told, all counted; in all. Ã And all, and the rest; and everything connected. Â½Bring our crown and all.Â¸ Shak. Ã At all. (a) In every respect; wholly; thoroughly. [Obs.] Â½She is a shrew at al(l).Â¸ Chaucer. (b) A phrase much used by way of enforcement or emphasis, usually in negative or interrogative sentences, and signifying in any way or respect; in the least degree or to the least extent; in the least; under any circumstances; as, he has no ambition at all; has he any property at all? Â½Nothing at all.Â¸ Shak. Â½It thy father at all miss me.Â¸ 1 Sam. xx. 6. Ã Over ~, everywhere. [Obs.] Chaucer.
Âµ All is much used in composition to enlarge the meaning, or add force to a word. In some instances, it is completely incorporated into words, and its final consonant is dropped, as in almighty, already, always: but, in most instances, it is an adverb prefixed to adjectives or participles, but usually with a hyphen, as, allÃbountiful, allÃglorious, allimportant, allÃsurrounding, etc. In others it is an adjective; as, allpower, allÃgiver. Anciently many words, as, alabout, alaground, etc., were compounded with all, which are now written separately.
All, conj. [Orig. all, adv., wholly: used with though or if, which being dropped before the subjunctive left all as if in the sense although.] Although; albeit. [Obs.]

AlÃleÂ¶giance (?), n. [OE. alegeaunce; pref. aÃ + OF. lige, liege. The meaning was influenced by L. ligare to bind, and even by lex, legis, law. See Liege, Ligeance.] 1. The tie or obligation, implied or expressed, which a subject owes to his sovereign or government; the duty of fidelity to one's king, government, or state.
2. Devotion; loyalty; as, allegiance to science.
Syn. - Loyalty; fealty. Ã Allegiance, Loyalty. These words agree in expressing the general idea of fidelity and attachment to the Â½powers that be.Â¸ Allegiance is an obligation to a ruling power. Loyalty is a feeling or sentiment towards such power. Allegiance may exist under any form of government, and, in a republic, we generally speak of allegiance to the government, to the state, etc. In well conducted monarchies, loyalty is a warmÃhearted feeling of fidelity and obedience to the sovereign. It is personal in its nature; and hence we speak of the loyalty of a wife to her husband, not of her allegiance. In cases where we personify, loyalty is more commonly the word used; as, loyalty to the constitution; loyalty to the cause of virtue; loyalty to truth and religion, etc.
Hear me, recreant, on thine allegiance hear me!
Shak.
So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found,...
Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,
His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal.
Milton.

Â½I am the Vine, ye are the branchesÂ¸ [John xv. 1Ã6] is a spoken allegory. In the parable there is no transference of properties. The parable of the sower [Matt. xiii. 3Ã23] represents all things as according to their proper nature.

Syn. - Friendly; peaceable; kind; harmonious. Ã Amicable, Friendly.

But rather famish them amid their plenty.
Shak.
Syn. Ã Amidst, Among. These words differ to some extent from each other, as will be seen from their etymology. Amidst denotes in the midst or middle of, and hence surrounded by; as, this work was written amidst many interruptions. Among denotes a mingling or intermixing with distinct or separable objects; as, Â½He fell among thieves.Â¸ Â½Blessed art thou among women.Â¸ Hence, we say, among the moderns, among the ancients, among the thickest of trees, among these considerations, among the reasons I have to offer. Amid and amidst are commonly used when the idea of separate or distinguishable objects is not prominent. Hence, we say, they kept on amidst the storm, amidst the gloom, he was sinking amidst the waves, he persevered amidst many difficulties; in none of which cases could among be used. In like manner, Milton speaks of Abdiel, Ã
The seraph Abdiel, faithful found;
Among the faithless faithful only he,
because he was then considered as one of the angels. But when the poet adds, Ã
From amidst them forth he passed,
we have rather the idea of the angels as a collective body.

Syn. - Old; primitive; pristine; antique; antiquated; oldÃfashioned; obsolete. Ã Ancient, Antiquated, Obsolete, Antique, Antic, Old. Ã Ancient is opposed to modern, and has antiquity; as, an ancient family, ancient landmarks, ancient institutions, systems of thought, etc. Antiquated describes that which has gone out of use or fashion; as, antiquated furniture, antiquated laws, rules, etc. Obsolete is commonly used, instead of antiquated, in reference to language, customs, etc.; as, an obsolete word or phrase, an obsolete expression. Antique is applied, in present usage, either to that which has come down from the ancients; as, an antique cameo, bust, etc.; or to that which is made to imitate some ~ work of art; as, an antique temple. In the days of Shakespeare, antique was often used for ancient; as, Â½an antique song,Â¸ Â½an antique Roman;Â¸ and hence, from singularity often attached to what is ~, it was used in the sense of grotesque; as, Â½an oak whose antique root peeps out; Â¸ and hence came our present word antic, denoting grotesque or ridiculous. We usually apply both ancient and old to things subject to gradual decay. We say, an old man, an ancient record; but never, the old stars, an old river or mountain. In general, however, ancient is opposed to modern, and old to new, fresh, or recent. When we speak of a thing that existed formerly, which has ceased to exist, we commonly use ancient; as, ancient republics, ancient heroes; and not old republics, old heroes. But when the thing which began or existed in former times is still in existence, we use either ancient or old; as, ancient statues or paintings, or old statues or paintings; ancient authors, or old authors, meaning books.

Shak.
Syn. - Resentment; wrath; rage; fury; passion; ire gall; choler; indignation; displeasure; vexation; grudge; spleen. Ã Anger, Indignation, Resentment, Wrath, Ire, Rage, Fury. Anger is a feeling of keen displeasure (usually with a desire to punish) for what we regard as wrong toward ourselves or others. It may be excessive or misplaced, but is not necessarily criminal. Indignation is a generous outburst of ~ in view of things which are indigna, or unworthy to be done, involving what is mean, cruel, flagitious, etc., in character or conduct. Resentment is often a moody feeling, leading one to brood over his supposed personal wrongs with a deep and lasting ~. See Resentment. Wrath and ire (the last poetical) express the feelings of one who is bitterly provoked. Rage is a vehement ebullition of ~; and fury is an excess of rage, amounting almost to madness. Warmth of constitution often gives rise to anger; a high sense of honor creates indignation at crime; a man of quick sensibilities is apt to cherish resentment; the wrath and ire of men are often connected with a haughty and vindictive spirit; rage and fury are distempers of the soul to be regarded only with abhorrence.

Syn. - Excuse. An apology, in the original sense of the word, was a pleading off from some charge or imputation, by explaining and defending one's principles or conduct. It therefore amounted to a vindication. One who offers an apology, admits himself to have been, at least apparently, in the wrong, but brings forward some palliating circumstance, or tenders a frank acknowledgment, by way of reparation. We make an apology for some breach of propriety or decorum (like rude expressions, unbecoming conduct, etc.), or some deficiency in what might be reasonably expected. We offer an excuse when we have been guilty of some breach or neglect of duty; and we do it by way of extenuating our fault, and with a view to be forgiven. When an excuse has been accepted, an apology may still, in some cases, be necessary or appropriate. Â½An excuse is not grounded on the claim of innocence, but is rather an appeal for favor resting on some collateral circumstance. An apology mostly respects the conduct of individuals toward each other as equals; it is a voluntary act produced by feelings of decorum, or a desire for the good opinion of others.Â¸

Syn. - To Appreciate, Estimate, Esteem. Estimate is an act of judgment; esteem is an act of valuing or prizing, and when applied to individuals, denotes a sentiment of moral approbation. See Estimate. Appreciate lies between the two. As compared with estimate, it supposes a union of sensibility with judgment, producing a nice and delicate perception. As compared with esteem, it denotes a valuation of things according to their appropriate and distinctive excellence, and not simply their moral worth. Thus, with reference to the former of these (delicate perception), an able writer says. Â½Women have a truer appreciation of character than men;Â¸ and another remarks, Â½It is difficult to appreciate the true force and distinctive sense of terms which we are every day using.Â¸ So, also, we speak of the difference between two things, as sometimes hardly appreciable. With reference to the latter of these (that of valuation as the result of a nice perception), we say, Â½It requires a pe??liar cast of character to appreciate the poetry of Wordsworth;Â¸ Â½He who has no delicacy himself, can  not appreciate it in others;Â¸ Â½The thought of death is salutary, because it leads us to appreciate worldly things aright.Â¸ Appreciate is much used in cases where something is in danger of being overlooked or undervalued; as when we speak of appreciating the difficulties of a subject, or the risk of an undertaking. So Lord Plunket, referring to an Â½ominous silenceÂ¸ which prevailed among the Irish peasantry, says, Â½If you knew now to appreciate that silence, it is more formidable than the most clamorous opposition.Â¸ In like manner, a person who asks some favor of another is apt to say, Â½I trust you will appreciate my motives in this request.Â¸ Here we have the key to a very frequent use of the word. It is hardly necessary to say that appreciate looks on the favorable side of things. we never speak of appreciating a man's faults, but his merits. This idea of regarding things favorably appears more fully in the word appreciative; as when we speak of an appreciative audience, or an appreciative review, meaning one that manifests a quick perception and a ready valuation of excellence.

Syn. - To catch; seize; arrest; detain; capture; conceive; understand; imagine; believe; fear; dread. Ã To Apprehend, Comprehend. These words come into comparison as describing acts of the mind.

The terms attachment and arrest are both applied to the taking or apprehension of a defendant to compel an appearance in a civil action. Attachment are issued at common law and is chancery, against persons for contempt of court. In England, attachment is employed in some cases where capias is with us, as against a witness who fails to appear on summons. In some of the New England States a writ of attachment is a species of mesne process upon which the property of a defendant may be saized at the commencement of a suit and before summons to him, and may be held to satisfy the judgment the plaintiff may recover. In other States this writ can issue only against absconding debtors and those who conceal themselves. See Foreign, Garnishment, Truster process.

Syn. - Attachment, Affection. The leading idea of affection is that of warmth and tenderness; the leading idea of attachment is that of being bound to some object by strong and lasting ties. There is more of sentiment (and sometimes of romance) in affection, and more of principle in preserving attachment. We speak of the ardor of the one, and the fidelity of the other. There is another distinction in the use and application of these words. The term attachment is applied to a wider range of objects than affection. A man may have a strong attachment to his country, to his profession, to his principles, and even to favorite places; in respect to none of these could we use the word affection.

To strike an attitude, to take an ~ for mere effect.
Syn. - Attitude, Posture. Both of these words describe the visible disposition of the limbs. Posture relates to their position merely; attitude refers to their fitness for some specific object.

Its object is the same with that of gesture; viz., to hold forth and represent. Posture has no such design. If we speak of posture in prayer, or the posture of devotion, it is only the natural disposition of the limbs, without any intention to show forth or exhibit.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
